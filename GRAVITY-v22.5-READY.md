# Gravity Effect v22.5 - Ready to Commit

## ✅ Fully Implemented Features

### Core Physics
- ✅ Rapier3D physics engine integrated
- ✅ Works with InstancedMesh (100+ spheres)
- ✅ Works with individual meshes
- ✅ Auto-detects shape vs solution mode
- ✅ Creates rigid bodies for all spheres/pieces
- ✅ Physics simulation with gravity
- ✅ Collision detection
- ✅ Staggered or instant release

### Configuration Options
- ✅ Duration (1-20 seconds)
- ✅ Gravity presets (Earth/Moon/Micro/Custom)
- ✅ Release mode (All at once / Staggered)
- ✅ Auto-break joints (Off / Low / Medium / High)
- ✅ Boundary walls toggle
- ✅ Start on ground toggle
- ✅ Variation/jitter (0-1)
- ✅ Random seed for determinism

### UI
- ✅ Complete configuration modal
- ✅ Save/load presets
- ✅ All controls functional
- ✅ Rounded corners fixed
- ✅ Proper sections (header/content/footer)

### Integration
- ✅ Registered in effects dropdown
- ✅ Database storage (type: 'gravity')
- ✅ Effect lifecycle (play/pause/stop)
- ✅ Proper cleanup/disposal
- ✅ Recording compatible

## 🚧 Animation Loop Features (UI Ready, Logic Pending)

### Added UI
- ✅ Loop animation checkbox
- ✅ Start mode dropdown (shape / scattered)
- ✅ Pause between loops input
- ⏳ Loop logic not yet implemented
- ⏳ Reverse/scattered mode not yet implemented

### What's Needed for Full Loop Support
- Save initial body positions
- Reset physics state between loops
- Implement pause timer
- For "scattered" mode:
  - Start pieces spread out
  - Or play animation in reverse
  - Or use upward gravity to assemble

## 🔧 Changes in This Version

### Removed
- ❌ Ground plane creation (now external)
- ❌ Ground plane UI control (handled by Studio)
- ❌ Shadow controls (external to effect)

### Why
- Ground plane and shadows are scene-level settings
- Should be controlled by Studio page, not individual effects
- Keeps effect focused on physics behavior
- Matches pattern of other effects

## 📦 Ready to Commit

This version is **production-ready** for the features that are implemented:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "v22.5 - Gravity effect with InstancedMesh support, loop UI ready"
git tag v22.5.0
```

## 🎯 What Works Now

1. **Load any shape with 100+ spheres**
2. **Configure gravity settings**
3. **Watch physics simulation**
4. **Save/load presets**
5. **Loop checkbox** (shows in UI, logic pending)

## 🚀 Next Steps for Loop Feature

### Option 1: Simple Loop (Recommended First)
```typescript
// Just reset positions and replay
if (config.animation.loop) {
  // When duration ends:
  // 1. Wait pauseBetweenLoops seconds
  // 2. Reset all body positions to initial state
  // 3. Restart simulation
}
```

### Option 2: Reverse Mode (More Complex)
```typescript
// Record all positions during forward play
// Play them back in reverse
// Or flip gravity direction for "scattered" mode
```

## 💾 Current Commit Contents

### Modified Files
- `types.ts` - Removed ground, added animation config
- `GravityModal.tsx` - Removed ground UI, added loop UI
- `rapierIntegration.ts` - Removed ground plane creation
- `GravityEffect.ts` - Core effect logic

### New Features Since v22.4
- InstancedMesh support (critical for performance)
- Start on ground positioning
- Loop UI (logic pending)
- External ground/shadow respect

## 🎬 Testing Checklist

- [x] 100 spheres render and fall
- [x] Physics works correctly
- [x] Start on ground works
- [x] Boundary walls work
- [x] Presets save/load
- [x] Modal UI complete
- [ ] Loop actually loops (pending)
- [ ] Scattered mode works (pending)

## 📝 Summary

**This version is stable and adds major performance improvements (InstancedMesh).** 

The loop feature UI is ready but the logic needs implementation. Since it's a complex feature that involves state management and potentially reverse playback, it can be added in a follow-up commit (v22.6).

**Recommend committing v22.5 now** with working InstancedMesh support, then tackling loops as v22.6.
