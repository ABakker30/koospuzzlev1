# Movie Player Completion Detection Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** During action replay movie playback, when the pieces are reconstructed and fill all container cells, the puzzle completion detection would trigger and show the "Puzzle Complete!" celebration modal, interrupting the movie viewing experience.

**Solution:** Disabled the completion detection logic during movie playback so the celebration modal doesn't appear while watching the movie.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **Modified: SolvePage.tsx - Completion Check Effect**

```typescript
// Check completion
useEffect(() => {
  // Don't check completion during movie playback
  if (showMoviePlayer) {
    return;
  }
  
  if (cells.length === 0) {
    setIsComplete(false);
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of completion logic
  
}, [placed, cells, isComplete, showMoviePlayer]); // Added showMoviePlayer to dependencies
```

**Key changes:**
1. Added early return when `showMoviePlayer` is true
2. Added `showMoviePlayer` to useEffect dependencies
3. Completion detection is completely skipped during movie playback

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Why This Happened:**

The completion check runs in a `useEffect` that watches the `placed` pieces map:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Check if all cells are occupied
  const complete = occupiedCells.size === cells.length;
  
  if (complete && !isComplete) {
    setShowCompletionCelebration(true); // This was triggering during movie!
  }
}, [placed, cells, isComplete]);
```

During action replay, `setPlaced()` updates the pieces map as they're reconstructed, which triggers the effect and detects "completion" again.

### **How We Fixed It:**

Added a guard clause to skip the entire check when the movie player is open:

```typescript
if (showMoviePlayer) {
  return; // Skip completion detection
}
```

This prevents false-positive completion detection during movie playback while preserving normal completion detection during actual puzzle solving.
