v28.11.0: Phase 2 Sprint 3 - Auto-Solve Integration (Core Implementation)

MAJOR NEW FEATURE: Auto-Solve Integration
- Engine 2 solver integrated into SolvePage
- Click Auto-Solve button to run algorithm
- Toggle between manual and auto solutions
- Auto solution renders with same visual quality

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Added Engine 2 imports and dependencies
- Piece database loads on mount
- handleAutoSolve() function runs Engine 2 solver
- convertPlacementToPieces() transforms engine output to PlacedPiece format
- Auto-Solve button wired up with solving state
- visiblePlacedPieces updated to show manual or auto solution
- handleStopAutoSolve() allows canceling mid-solve

BUTTON STATES:
- Default: "ü§ñ Auto-Solve" - Click to start solving
- Solving: "‚è≥ Solving..." - Disabled while running
- After solve: "üë§ Manual" - Click to switch back to manual view

VIEW MODES:
- Manual mode: Shows user's manual solution with all controls
- Auto mode: Shows algorithm solution, reveal/explosion sliders work

TECHNICAL:
- Uses engine2Precompute + engine2Solve pattern
- Conversion loads GoldOrientationService for piece data
- Auto solution pieces get unique UIDs (auto-${pieceId}-${index})
- Both solutions support reveal slider filtering
- Explosion slider works on both manual and auto

STATE MANAGEMENT:
- piecesDb: Loaded piece database
- isAutoSolving: Currently solving flag
- autoSolveStatus: Engine status updates
- autoSolution: Found solution pieces
- showAutoSolve: View toggle (manual/auto)

NEXT STEPS:
- Add progress indicator UI
- Add comparison stats display
- Test with real puzzles
- Add stop button during solve

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/pages/solve/SolvePage.tsx - Core implementation

FILES ADDED:
- PHASE2-SPRINT3-AUTOSOLVE-PLAN.md - Implementation plan

Ready for testing and UI polish!
