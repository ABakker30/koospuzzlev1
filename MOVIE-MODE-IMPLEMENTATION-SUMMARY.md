**Status:** Phase 1-3 Complete (Core Functionality)  
**Date:** October 31, 2025 - 3:30 AM  
**Ready for Testing:** Morning ☀️

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)**
- ✅ Added `SolveMode` type: `'manual' | 'automated' | 'movie'`
- ✅ Added mode state management with backward compatibility
- ✅ Imported all Movie Mode dependencies (effects, modals, TransportBar)
- ✅ Added effect-related state (effectContext, activeEffect, modal states)
- ✅ Added real scene objects state for EffectContext

### **Phase 2: Effects Integration (COMPLETE)**
- ✅ Built EffectContext from real Three.js scene objects
- ✅ Added effect activation handler (`handleActivateEffect`)
- ✅ Added effect clear handler (`handleClearEffect`)
- ✅ Added effect selection handler (`handleEffectSelect`)
- ✅ Added modal save handlers for all three effects:
  - `handleTurnTableSave`
  - `handleRevealSave`
  - `handleGravitySave`
- ✅ Added effect tick loop (60 FPS direct Three.js updates)
- ✅ Added cleanup on mode switch

### **Phase 3: UI & Components (COMPLETE)**
- ✅ Added three-button mode selector (Manual | Automated | Movie)
- ✅ Added effects dropdown in Movie mode with three effects:
  - 🔄 Turntable
  - ✨ Reveal
  - 🌍 Gravity
- ✅ Added "Clear Effect" button when effect is active
- ✅ Added TransportBar component (Play/Pause/Stop/Record)
- ✅ Added all three effect modals (TurnTable, Reveal, Gravity)
- ✅ Connected SceneCanvas to provide real scene objects via `onSceneReady`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`src/pages/solve/SolvePage.tsx`** - Main implementation
   - Added imports for effects system
   - Added Movie Mode state
   - Added effect handlers
   - Added UI components
   - Added modals

2. **`src/components/SceneCanvas.tsx`** - Scene integration
   - Added `onSceneReady` callback prop
   - Calls callback with scene, camera, renderer, controls, spheresGroup, centroidWorld
   - Provides direct access to Three.js objects

### **Key Patterns Used:**

**Effect Activation:**
```typescript
const instance = new effectDef.constructor();
instance.init(effectContext);  // Direct Three.js access
instance.setConfig(config);
setActiveEffectInstance(instance);
```

**Effect Tick Loop:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!activeEffectInstance) return;
  const tick = () => {
    activeEffectInstance.tick(performance.now() / 1000);
    requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  };
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
}, [activeEffectInstance]);
```

**No React Re-renders During Playback:**
- Effects manipulate Three.js objects directly
- No state updates during animation
- Smooth, jitter-free recording

## 🎯 How to Test (Morning Checklist)

### **1. Mode Switching**
- [ ] Click Manual mode → verify it works as before
- [ ] Click Automated mode → verify auto-solver works
- [ ] Click Movie mode → verify UI changes

### **2. Movie Mode UI**
- [ ] Verify "✨ Select Effect" dropdown appears
- [ ] Click dropdown → verify three effects shown
- [ ] Verify dropdown styling matches Studio

### **3. Effect Selection & Configuration**
- [ ] Select Turntable → modal opens
- [ ] Configure settings → click Save
- [ ] Verify effect activates (button shows "Effect: turntable")
- [ ] Repeat for Reveal and Gravity

### **4. Effect Playback**
- [ ] Activate Turntable effect
- [ ] Verify TransportBar appears (Play/Pause/Stop/Record)
- [ ] Click Play → puzzle should rotate smoothly
- [ ] Click Pause → rotation should pause
- [ ] Click Stop → should return to start
- [ ] Verify NO jitter or lag

### **5. Recording**
- [ ] Activate any effect
- [ ] Click Play
- [ ] Click Record button
- [ ] Verify recording starts
- [ ] Let effect complete
- [ ] Verify WebM file downloads
- [ ] Check file quality and smoothness

### **6. Edge Cases**
- [ ] Switch from Movie to Manual mid-playback → effect should cleanup
- [ ] Activate effect, then select different effect → old effect clears
- [ ] Click outside dropdown → dropdown closes

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

### **Minor Cleanup Needed:**
- ⚠️ Some unused imports (PlaybackFrame, T_ijk_to_xyz, showInfo) - harmless
- ⚠️ Console warnings about unused variables - doesn't affect functionality

### **Not Yet Implemented (Phase 4-8):**
- ❌ Credits modal customization
- ❌ URL params handling (auto-play from shared links)
- ❌ Database integration (save movies)
- ❌ Movie Gallery (browse/discover movies)
- ❌ Old MoviePlayer removal

## 💤 Good Night!

**Core Movie Mode is ready for testing!** 🎉

The foundation is solid. All three effects (Turntable, Reveal, Gravity) are integrated and should work smoothly. TransportBar gives full playback control. Recording should capture smooth video without jitter.

**Wake up and test!** If it works, we'll add the remaining features (credits, URLs, gallery). If there are bugs, we'll debug together.

Sleep well! 🌙✨
