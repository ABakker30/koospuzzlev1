Implement Movie Mode (Phases 1-3): Core effects system integration

MAJOR FEATURE: Movie Mode for creating shareable puzzle animations

Added integrated Movie Mode to SolvePage using Studio's effects system for
smooth, professional movie creation without React re-renders during playback.

Key Changes:
- Added SolveMode type: 'manual' | 'automated' | 'movie'
- Integrated three effects: Turntable, Reveal, Gravity
- Added effects dropdown UI with Studio-style modal configs
- Integrated TransportBar (Play/Pause/Stop/Record controls)
- Connected SceneCanvas to provide real Three.js scene objects
- Added effect tick loop with direct mesh manipulation (no React updates)
- Implemented EffectContext building from solve page scene

Architecture:
- Reuses all Studio effect components (modals, TransportBar, RecordingService)
- Effects manipulate Three.js objects directly for smooth playback
- No geometry rebuilding during animation (just visibility/position changes)
- Canvas capture works cleanly without overlay clearing issues

UI Changes:
- Three-button mode selector replaces two-button toggle
- Movie mode shows effects dropdown in center controls
- TransportBar appears when effect is active
- Effect modals for configuration (TurnTable, Reveal, Gravity)

Technical Details:
- Effects tick at 60 FPS via requestAnimationFrame
- Recording captures at 30 FPS for optimal quality/size
- Effect cleanup on mode switch prevents memory leaks
- EffectContext provides direct access to scene, camera, renderer

Files Modified:
- src/pages/solve/SolvePage.tsx (main integration)
- src/components/SceneCanvas.tsx (onSceneReady callback)

Next Steps (Phase 4-8):
- Credits modal with customization
- URL params for sharing
- Database integration
- Movie Gallery
