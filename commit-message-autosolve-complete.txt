v28.14.0: Complete Auto-Solve Integration with Live Rendering and Settings

MAJOR FEATURE: Full auto-solve functionality in SolvePage

AUTO-SOLVE FEATURES:
- Live piece rendering during solving (shows intermediate stack)
- Real-time progress indicator (depth, nodes, nodes/sec)
- Engine settings modal for solver configuration
- Stop button to cancel mid-solve
- Solution display when complete
- Toggle between manual and auto solutions

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Added EngineSettingsModal for configuration
- Engine2Settings state with sensible defaults
- Intermediate piece rendering from StatusV2.stack
- Convert stack placements to PlacedPiece format on-the-fly
- Progress overlay shows solving status
- Settings button in header (gear icon)

RENDERING:
- Auto-solve intermediate pieces update in real-time
- GoldOrientationService converts placements to geometry
- visiblePlacedPieces shows current solver state while solving
- Smooth transition to final solution when complete

SETTINGS CONFIGURABLE:
- Max solutions (default: 1)
- Timeout (default: 60s)
- Move ordering
- Pruning options (connectivity, multipleOf4, colorResidue, neighborTouch)
- Status update interval (default: 500ms)
- Random seed
- Stall detection (optional)
- Tail switch (optional)

PROGRESS INDICATOR:
- Green overlay at top during solving
- Shows: Depth, Nodes explored, Nodes/sec
- Stop button to cancel
- Auto-hides when complete

USER FLOW:
1. Click Settings to configure solver (optional)
2. Click Auto-Solve button
3. Watch pieces appear as solver explores
4. See progress stats updating
5. Stop anytime or wait for solution
6. Toggle between manual/auto views

TECHNICAL:
- useEffect converts StatusV2.stack to PlacedPiece[] asynchronously
- Reuses convertPlacementToPieces for consistency
- Engine settings passed directly to engine2Solve
- Intermediate pieces stored in separate state
- visiblePlacedPieces prioritizes auto-solve state

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/pages/solve/SolvePage.tsx - Full integration

TESTING:
- Load any puzzle URL
- Click Settings - modal opens
- Adjust pruning/timeout - settings save
- Click Auto-Solve - solver starts
- Pieces render progressively - live updates
- Progress shows depth/nodes - real-time stats
- Click Stop - solver pauses
- Solution completes - pieces stay visible

Phase 2 Sprint 3 COMPLETE! Auto-solve fully integrated and working.
Ready for end-to-end testing and Phase 3 (Gallery).
