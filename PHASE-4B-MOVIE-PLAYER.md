# Phase 4B: Movie Player - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Objective
Build a movie player UI with playback controls for replaying solve actions and generating animated visualizations.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **MoviePlayer Component** (`MoviePlayer.tsx`)
Full-featured movie player with professional controls and multiple playback modes.

**Features:**
- ✅ Three animation modes
- ✅ Play/Pause/Stop controls
- ✅ Timeline scrubber
- ✅ Speed controls (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- ✅ Step forward/backward
- ✅ Progress indicator
- ✅ Turntable rotation toggle
- ✅ Frame-by-frame playback
- ✅ Auto-stop at end

---

## 🎬 Animation Modes

### **1. Action Replay** 🎮
Replays exactly what the user did during manual solve.

**Status:** UI Complete, Logic Pending
**Shows:**
- Piece-by-piece placement in solve order
- User's actual choices and timing
- Trial and error process
- Undo sequences

**Data Source:** `solveActions` array
**Frame Delay:** 800ms (adjustable with speed)

**Next Step:** Implement scene reconstruction from actions

---

### **2. Reveal Animation** 📊  
Smooth assembly sequence showing pieces appearing one by one.

**Status:** ✅ FULLY WORKING
**Shows:**
- Pieces revealed in placement order
- Clean assembly sequence
- Educational/preview mode

**Implementation:**
```typescript
frameData.revealK = step; // 1 → N
frameData.explosionFactor = 0; // No explosion
```

**How it works:**
- Animates reveal slider programmatically
- Uses existing reveal logic in SolvePage
- Pieces appear smoothly in order

---

### **3. Explosion Combo** 💥
Cinematic "fly-in" effect with pieces assembling from exploded state.

**Status:** ✅ FULLY WORKING
**Shows:**
- Pieces start exploded (100%)
- Pieces fly in one by one
- Explosion decreases as assembly progresses
- Dramatic self-assembly effect

**Implementation:**
```typescript
frameData.revealK = step; // Pieces to show
frameData.explosionFactor = 1 - (step / totalSteps); // 100% → 0%
```

**Visual Effect:**
1. Start: All pieces exploded and hidden
2. Step 1: First piece flies in from explosion position
3. Step N: Last piece settles into place
4. End: Fully assembled puzzle

---

## 🎮 Playback Controls

### **Main Controls**
- **⏹️ Stop** - Reset to beginning
- **⏮️ Prev** - Previous step
- **▶️ Play** - Start playback
- **⏸️ Pause** - Pause playback
- **⏭️ Next** - Next step

### **Speed Options**
- **0.5x** - Slow motion (1600ms/800ms/600ms per step)
- **1x** - Normal speed (800ms/400ms/300ms)
- **2x** - Double speed
- **5x** - Fast (160ms/80ms/60ms)
- **10x** - Very fast (80ms/40ms/30ms)

### **Timeline**
- Draggable scrubber
- Visual progress bar
- Skip to any frame
- Time display (current/total)

### **Options**
- 🔄 **Turntable Rotation** - Checkbox to enable/disable auto-rotation during playback

---

## 🔗 Integration with SolvePage

### **Trigger Points**
1. **Completion Celebration** - "🎬 Make Movie" button appears
2. **Button Click** - Opens full-screen movie player
3. **Player Controls** - User selects mode and plays

### **Playback Frame Handler**
```typescript
onPlaybackFrame={(frame) => {
  // Reveal & Explosion modes
  if (frame.mode === 'reveal-animation' || frame.mode === 'explosion-combo') {
    setRevealK(frame.revealK); // Update reveal slider
    setExplosionFactor(frame.explosionFactor); // Update explosion
  }
  
  // Action replay mode (TODO)
  // Reconstruct scene step by step from actions
}}
```

### **Data Flow**
```
MoviePlayer
  ↓ emits PlaybackFrame
SolvePage Handler
  ↓ updates state
SceneCanvas
  ↓ renders
3D Scene Updates
```

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Frame Timing**
```typescript
const frameDelay = baseDelay / playbackSpeed;

// Base delays by mode:
- action-replay: 800ms (realistic pace)
- reveal-animation: 400ms (smooth)
- explosion-combo: 300ms (cinematic)
```

### **Animation Loop**
Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps rendering:
1. Check elapsed time since last frame
2. If >= frameDelay, advance step
3. Emit playback frame
4. Continue if still playing

### **Progress Calculation**
```typescript
progress = (currentStep / totalSteps) * 100;
estimatedDuration = (totalSteps * frameDelay) / 1000;
```

- Centered controls
- Professional layout
- Max-width 800px
