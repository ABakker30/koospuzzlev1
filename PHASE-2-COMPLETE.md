# ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Contract Wiring

## Status: ALL PAGES WIRED

Phase 2 of the Windsurf Program is **100% complete**. All 5 pages now follow the active state contract.

---

## Pages Implemented

### ✅ A) Shape Editor
**Contract Implemented:**
- ✅ On load: Sets `activeState` with shapeRef and empty placements
- ✅ On save: Resets `activeState` with new shapeRef after saving

**Changes:**
- Added `useActiveState` hook
- Calls `setActiveState()` in `onLoaded()`
- Calls `setActiveState()` after save in `onSave()`

### ✅ B) Auto Solver  
**Contract Implemented:**
- ✅ On mount: Auto-loads shape from `activeState.shapeRef` (no Browse needed)
- ✅ On solution saved: Sets `activeState` with full solution
- ✅ Logs placements count (seeding not yet implemented but ready)

**Changes:**
- Added `useActiveState` hook
- Auto-load effect fetches shape from storage on mount
- Updates `activeState` after saving solution

### ✅ C) Solution Viewer
**Contract Implemented:**
- ✅ On load: Sets `activeState` from loaded koos.state@1 solution
- ✅ Modified modal to pass original koos.state along with converted solution

**Changes:**
- Added `useActiveState` hook
- Modal passes `koosState` as 3rd parameter
- Calls `setActiveState()` after loading solution

### ✅ D) Manual Puzzle
**Contract Implemented:**
- ✅ On mount: Auto-loads shape from `activeState.shapeRef` (no Browse needed)
- ✅ On save: Sets `activeState` with complete solution
- ✅ TODO noted: Restore placements from activeState (future enhancement)

**Changes:**
- Added `useActiveState` hook  
- Auto-load effect fetches shape from storage on mount
- Updates `activeState` after saving solution

### ✅ E) Content Studio
**Contract Implemented:**
- ✅ On mount: Auto-loads shape from `activeState.shapeRef` (no Browse needed)
- ✅ Read-only consumption (no writes)
- ✅ Logs activeState when available

**Changes:**
- Added `useActiveState` hook
- Auto-load effect fetches shape from storage on mount
- Read-only: doesn't modify activeState

## Transition Flow Examples

### Flow 1: Shape → Studio
```
1. Load shape in Shape Editor
   → activeState = { shapeRef: "sha256:abc...", placements: [] }

2. Navigate to Content Studio
   → Studio auto-loads shape from shapeRef
   → Shape appears automatically!
```

### Flow 2: Shape → Solve → View
```
1. Load shape in Shape Editor
   → activeState = { shapeRef: "sha256:abc...", placements: [] }

2. Navigate to Auto Solver
   → Solver auto-loads shape from shapeRef
   → Shape appears automatically!
   
3. Find solution, click "Save"
   → activeState = { shapeRef: "sha256:abc...", placements: [25 pieces] }

4. Navigate to Solution Viewer
   → Can load the saved solution from cloud
   → activeState updated with solution data
```

### Flow 3: Shape → Puzzle → Save
```
1. Load shape in Shape Editor
   → activeState = { shapeRef: "sha256:abc...", placements: [] }

2. Navigate to Manual Puzzle
   → Puzzle auto-loads shape from shapeRef
   → Shape appears automatically!
   
3. Place pieces manually, complete puzzle
   → Click "Save Solution"
   → activeState = { shapeRef: "sha256:abc...", placements: [N pieces] }

4. Navigate to Solution Viewer
   → Load saved solution to view it
```

## Console Logs to Expect

### Shape Editor
```
✅ Shape Editor: ActiveState set with shapeRef
✅ Shape Editor: ActiveState reset with new shapeRef after save
```

### Auto Solver
```
⚙️ Auto Solver: ActiveState available { shapeRef: '...', placements: N }
🔄 Auto Solver: Auto-loading shape from activeState...
✅ Auto Solver: Auto-loaded shape from activeState
✅ Auto Solver: ActiveState updated with saved solution
```

### Solution Viewer
```
✅ Loaded koos.state@1: sha256:... (N placements)
✅ Solution Viewer: ActiveState set from loaded solution
```

### Manual Puzzle
```
🧩 Manual Puzzle: ActiveState available { shapeRef: '...', placements: N }
🔄 Manual Puzzle: Auto-loading shape from activeState...
✅ Manual Puzzle: Auto-loaded shape from activeState
✅ Manual Puzzle: ActiveState updated with saved solution
```

### Content Studio
```
🎬 Content Studio: ActiveState available (read-only) { shapeRef: '...', placements: N }
🔄 Content Studio: Auto-loading shape from activeState...
✅ Content Studio: Auto-loaded shape from activeState
```

---

## Build Status

```
✅ npm run build - SUCCESS
✅ No critical errors
✅ Bundle: 1.146 MB (gzipped: 315 KB)
✅ All pages compile
```

### Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Dynamic import of supabase.ts (optimization, not an error)
- Unused imports in ContentStudioPage (pre-existing, cosmetic)
- Chunk size warning (pre-existing)

---

## What Works Now

### ✅ Auto-Load Everywhere
- Shape Editor → Studio: Shape auto-loads
- Shape Editor → Solver: Shape auto-loads
- Shape Editor → Puzzle: Shape auto-loads
- Solution Viewer → Studio: Shape from solution auto-loads (future)
- No manual "Browse" clicks needed after first load

### ✅ State Handoff
- State survives page navigation
- shapeRef passes between pages
- Placements preserved in memory
- Each page consumes what it needs

### ✅ Contract Compliance
- Shape: read/write shape only
- Solve: read shape, write solution
- View: read solution only
- Puzzle: read shape, write solution
- Studio: read-only consumption

---

## What's NOT in Phase 2

❌ **Placeholder UI for missing shapeRef** - Not implemented
❌ **Seeding solver from partial placements** - Logged but not used yet
❌ **Restoring puzzle placements** - TODO noted in code
❌ **Phase 3 - Save/Load State Files** - Future work

These are acceptable limitations for Phase 2. The core contract wiring is complete.

## Files Modified

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
- `src/services/ActiveStateService.ts` (new)
- `src/context/ActiveStateContext.tsx` (new)
- `src/App.tsx` (wrapped with provider)

### Phase 2 (Contract Wiring)
- `src/pages/ShapeEditorPage.tsx` (~15 lines)
- `src/pages/AutoSolverPage.tsx` (~65 lines)
- `src/pages/SolutionViewerPage.tsx` (~20 lines)
- `src/pages/ManualPuzzle/ManualPuzzlePage.tsx` (~65 lines)
- `src/pages/ContentStudioPage.tsx` (~50 lines)
- `src/components/BrowseContractSolutionsModal.tsx` (~5 lines)

**Total:** ~220 lines of changes across 7 files

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Optional)

Phase 3 is **optional** and focused on file-based state persistence:

1. Add "Save State" button in Puzzle (partial solutions)
2. Add "Load State" in Browse modal (states vs solutions)
3. Store in `states/<id>.state.json`
4. Keep in-memory state as primary

This can be deferred. Phase 2 provides the core functionality.
