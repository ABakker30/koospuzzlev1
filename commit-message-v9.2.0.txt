v9.2.0: Fix raycasting accuracy, preset persistence, and HDR loading

Major bug fixes and improvements:

RAYCASTING ACCURACY FIX:
- Added visibleCellsRef to cache visible cells array during mesh creation
- Fixed interaction handler to use cached array instead of rebuilding
- Resolves bug where second click selected wrong cell after ghost appeared
- Root cause: mesh rebuilt when ghost appeared, changing instanceId mapping

PRESET PERSISTENCE FIX:
- Fixed brightness=0 bug in database presets with default correction
- Implemented deep merge for nested lights properties: hdr, shadows, directional
- Added save verification to confirm localStorage persistence
- Settings now properly persist across page reloads

HDR LOADING FIX:
- Fixed race condition in React strict mode with HDRLoader initialization
- Added hdrInitialized state to coordinate effect execution order
- Lighting effect now waits for HDR loader before loading environments
- Added safety checks to prevent PMREM generator undefined errors
- Conditional reset logic to avoid destroying loader mid-operation

All changes tested and verified working.
