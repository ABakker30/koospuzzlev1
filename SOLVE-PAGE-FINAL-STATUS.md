## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management (~25 state variables)
- Puzzle data (cells, view, loaded)
- Solving (timer, moves, completion)
- Board (placed pieces, selected, anchors, fits)
- Undo/Redo stacks
- Drawing mode
- Reveal/explosion visualization
- UI modals and notifications

### Key Functions
1. `handleConfirmFit()` - Place piece + start timer
2. `handleCellClick()` - Show fits or draw mode
3. `handleDrawCell()` - Build 4-cell drawn piece
4. `identifyAndPlacePiece()` - Match drawn shape
5. `handleInteraction()` - Behavior table router
6. `handleSaveSolution()` - Save with metadata to Supabase
7. `handleUndo/Redo()` - Full history management

### Derived State
- `visiblePlacedPieces` - Filters pieces based on reveal slider
- `currentFit` - Current ghost preview from fits array

## 💾 Database Integration

### Solutions Table
```sql
INSERT INTO solutions (
  puzzle_id,           -- Foreign key to puzzles
  solver_name,         -- From modal (required)
  solution_type,       -- 'manual'
  final_geometry,      -- Array of IJK cells
  actions,             -- Empty for now (Phase 4)
  solve_time_ms,       -- From timer
  move_count,          -- From counter
  notes                -- From modal (optional)
)
```

## 🎮 User Flow

### Solving Flow
1. Navigate to `/solve/:id`
2. Puzzle loads and renders
3. User places pieces:
   - **Method A**: Click cell → R to rotate → Enter to place
   - **Method B**: Double-click 4 adjacent cells to draw
4. Timer starts on first move
5. Moves counted automatically
6. Pieces filtered by reveal slider (when complete)

### Completion Flow
1. All cells filled → completion detected
2. 🎉 Celebration overlay appears
3. Click "Save Solution" → modal opens
4. Enter name and notes
5. Submit → saves to database

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Explosion Slider Visual Effect
The explosion slider UI is complete and functional, but the visual separation effect requires SceneCanvas to implement explosion transformation. This is **optional** and can be added later if needed.

**To implement:**
- Calculate piece centroids
- Move pieces radially from center
- Scale by `explosionFactor`
- Similar to solution-viewer implementation
