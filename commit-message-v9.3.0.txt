v9.3.0: Gallery page, auto-solve construction animation, and navigation improvements

PHASE 3 COMPLETE: Basic Gallery implementation with real data integration

GALLERY PAGE (NEW):
- /gallery route with responsive grid layout
- Public Puzzles / My Puzzles tab system
- Real-time data loading from Supabase with joined cell counts
- Share button with clipboard copy and toast notification
- Create Puzzle button (prominent + empty state)
- SEO meta tags for social sharing (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Loading, error, and empty states with context-aware messaging
- Fun, bouncy button animations with lift and glow effects

DATABASE INTEGRATION:
- New puzzles API with contracts_shapes join for cell counts
- Fetches shape size from contracts_shapes.size via shape_id
- Properly handles PuzzleRecord interface with all fields
- Fixed schema mapping (visibility, creator_name, shape_id)

NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Gallery button added to Solve page header (far right)
- Gallery button added to Create page header (far right)
- Consistent "⊞ Gallery" button across all pages
- Updated error state buttons to navigate to gallery
- Clean circular navigation: Gallery ↔ Create ↔ Solve

AUTO-SOLVE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Animated construction with 150ms delay per piece placement
- Container cells hidden (opacity 0) once solution is found
- Construction animation shows pieces appearing one by one
- Reveal slider works after construction completes
- Slider disabled during animation, enabled after
- Default shows all pieces after construction

REVEAL SLIDER FIXES:
- Fixed slider enabling for auto-solve solutions
- Proper max value from autoSolution.length
- Correct label showing current/total pieces
- Slider controls piece visibility after construction
- Clean state management when switching modes

UI POLISH:
- Updated title to "KOOS Puzzle Gallery" (all caps)
- Bouncy cubic-bezier animations on buttons
- Consistent rounded corners (12px) across UI
- Enhanced shadows and hover effects
- Scrollable gallery container

TECHNICAL:
- useEffect-based construction animation with cleanup
- autoConstructionIndex state tracking
- Proper TypeScript types for all new interfaces
- Dependency array management for effects
- Boolean coercion fixes for TypeScript

All features tested and working. Core create-gallery-solve loop now complete.
