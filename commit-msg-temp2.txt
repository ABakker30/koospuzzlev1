Fix camera jitter and persist auto-solve settings

BUG FIX - Camera jitter during reveal slider:
- Stable explosion center stored in ref
- Only recalculates when pieces added or cleared
- Prevents piece shifting when reveal slider changes
- User has full camera control with no automatic adjustments

FEATURE - Auto-solve settings persistence:
- Settings saved to localStorage on change
- Loaded from localStorage on mount
- Persists across sessions and page reloads
- Includes all engine parameters: timeout, strategies, pruning options

TECHNICAL:
- explosionCenterRef caches center point calculation
- explosionPieceCountRef tracks when to recalculate
- localStorage key: solve.autoSolveSettings
