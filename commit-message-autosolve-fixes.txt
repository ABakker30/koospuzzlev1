v28.15.0: Fix Auto-Solve UI Issues and Enable Reveal Slider

CRITICAL FIXES for auto-solve rendering and mode isolation:

PIECE RENDERING FIX:
- Fixed pieces not rendering during auto-solve
- Root cause: SceneCanvas checks `if (!onSelectPiece) return;`
- Solution: Pass empty function `() => {}` instead of `undefined`
- Now pieces render in real-time during solving

ORIENTATION SERVICE OPTIMIZATION:
- Pre-load GoldOrientationService once on mount
- Use cached service for all status updates (was creating new service every update)
- Synchronous conversion instead of async (much faster)
- Performance: Hundreds of status updates per second now work smoothly

MODE ISOLATION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Disable keyboard shortcuts in automated mode (R, Enter, Delete, Undo/Redo)
- Clear anchor/preview/selection when in automated mode
- Clear drawingCells in automated mode
- Force hidePlacedPieces=false in automated mode
- All manual interactions disabled when showAutoSolve=true

REVEAL SLIDER ENABLED:
- Set revealMax and revealK when solution found
- Works for both manual and auto-solve modes
- Shows all pieces initially, then user can slide to reveal gradually
- Simplified logic: enable when revealMax > 0

DRAGGABLE PROGRESS INDICATOR:
- Smaller, compact design (180px vs 300px)
- Draggable anywhere on screen
- No Stop button (moved to header)
- Shows: Depth, Nodes, Nodes/sec

DEBUG LOGGING ADDED:
- Track orientation service loading
- Log piece conversion count
- Log visible pieces updates
- Warn on missing orientations
- Full stack trace on errors

PROP CHANGES TO SceneCanvas:
When in automated mode (showAutoSolve=true):
- anchor → null (no ghost)
- previewOffsets → null (no preview)
- selectedPieceUid → null (no selection)
- onSelectPiece → (() => {}) (empty function, not undefined)
- drawingCells → [] (clear drawing)
- hidePlacedPieces → false (force show)
- onInteraction → undefined (no manual clicks)

ISSUES FIXED:
✅ Pieces not rendering during auto-solve
✅ Cells disappearing during status updates
✅ Manual mode features interfering with automated
✅ Slow performance from repeated service loading
✅ Reveal slider not working for auto-solve
✅ Keyboard shortcuts active in automated mode

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Real-time piece rendering during solve
- Smooth status updates
- Clean mode separation
- Working reveal slider
- Draggable progress indicator

All auto-solve features now working correctly!
