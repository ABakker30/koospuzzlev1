# Movie Player Canvas Brightness Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** The movie player modal had a semi-transparent black backdrop that darkened the 3D canvas, making it harder to see the animation clearly during playback.

**Solution:** Removed the backdrop overlay entirely so the canvas stays at full brightness during movie playback.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **1. Removed Backdrop Overlay**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<>
  <div onClick={onClose} style={{
    position: 'fixed',
    inset: 0,
    background: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',  // 50% black overlay
    zIndex: 3000
  }} />
  <div>Modal content...</div>
</>

// AFTER:
<>
  {/* No backdrop - canvas stays bright */}
  <div>Modal content...</div>
</>
```

### **2. Enhanced Modal Visibility**
Since there's no backdrop to provide contrast, I strengthened the modal's visual presence:

**Shadow:**
- Before: `0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`
- After: `0 16px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)` ← Stronger, deeper shadow

**Border:**
- Before: `2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)`
- After: `3px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)` ← Thicker, more visible

### **Z-Index Layers:**
```
Modal: 3001 (floating on top)
Canvas: Default (1-1000 range)
No backdrop layer anymore
