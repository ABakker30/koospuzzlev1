Gallery movie post-playback: challenge modal with solution exploration

After a gallery movie plays once, user sees challenge modal with two options:

1. **Accept Challenge** - Clears solution and reloads puzzle to try solving it fresh
2. **Close/Browse More** - Reloads page to show solution with sliders (clean state)

Key implementation:
- Challenge modal displays when effect completes (one cycle, no loop)
- galleryMovieCompleted flag prevents effect from re-activating infinitely
- Effect instance cleared immediately to stop tick loop
- "Accept Challenge" clears movie state and reloads page with empty puzzle
- Modal close navigates to /solve/{puzzleId} for clean solution view
- Page reload gives fresh Three.js scene without effect artifacts
- Solution loads from database with working reveal/explosion sliders
- Prevent unwanted success modal from appearing for gallery movies
- Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting state transitions
