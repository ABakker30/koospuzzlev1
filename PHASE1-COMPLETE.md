4. **✅ Supabase Database Integration**
   - Complete schema with RLS policies
   - UUID-based puzzle IDs

   - Real-time save to cloud database

5. **✅ Playback System**
   - Duration-based animation (5-30s, default 5s)
   - Even action distribution (N+1 intervals)
   - Play/Pause/Stop controls
   - Progress indicators
   - Smooth state transitions

6. **✅ Movie Recording** (Phase 4 feature, implemented early!)

     - Recorded (gray) - Click to re-record
   - Automatic playback during recording

7. **✅ Share Modal**
   - Copy puzzle URL to clipboard
   - Share to social media (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit)
   - Ready for Phase 2 solve links

## 📊 Database Schema

### Puzzles Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE puzzles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  creator_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  challenge_message TEXT,
  visibility TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public',
  geometry JSONB NOT NULL,
  actions JSONB NOT NULL,
  preset_config JSONB,
  sphere_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
  creation_time_ms INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Row Level Security
- Public puzzles viewable by everyone
- Anyone can create puzzles (no auth required yet)
- Solutions table ready for Phase 2

## 🎬 User Workflow

```
1. CREATE
   └─ /create route
   └─ Add spheres (double-click ghosts)
   └─ Minimum 4 spheres (multiple of 4)
   
2. SAVE
   └─ Click Save button
   └─ Fill metadata form
   └─ Auto-save to Supabase
   └─ Generate UUID + URL
   
3. PLAYBACK
   └─ Auto-transition to playback mode
   └─ Play/Pause/Stop controls
   └─ Watch creation replay
   
4. RECORD (Optional)
   └─ Click Record button
   └─ Configure settings
   └─ Press Play to start
   └─ Auto-download video
   
5. SHARE
   └─ Click Share button
   └─ Copy URL or share social
   └─ URL: koospuzzle.com/solve/{uuid}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/pages/create/
├── CreatePage-clean.tsx          # Main page component
├── CreateMode.css                 # Styles

PHASE1-SETUP.md                   # Setup instructions
```

### Key Technologies
- React + TypeScript
- Three.js (3D rendering)
- Supabase (Database + RLS)
- Canvas Recording API
- React Hooks (state management)

### State Management
- `pageMode`: 'edit' | 'playback'
- `actions`: Array of creation events
- `cells`: Current IJK geometry
- `savedCells`: Final state for playback
- `settings`: Environment configuration

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Development**: Building features one at a time
2. **Early Movie Integration**: Implementing Phase 4 early proved valuable
3. **Action Tracking**: Clean separation between UI and data
4. **Supabase**: Easy to integrate, powerful RLS

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Timing Distribution**: N+1 intervals for proper final state visibility
2. **Recording Modal**: Eliminated blocking modal during recording
3. **Button States**: Single button with 4 states cleaner than multiple
4. **Text Visibility**: Solid backgrounds for any scene color

### Design Decisions
1. **No Complete Mode**: Staying in playback mode after recording
2. **Re-recordable**: Gray button clickable to record again
3. **Default 5s**: Shorter default duration better for testing
4. **Duration in Modal**: Cleaner than toolbar display

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: Anyone can create puzzles (will add later)
2. **No Solve Mode**: URLs generated but not handled yet (Phase 2)
3. **No Gallery**: Can't browse puzzles yet (Phase 3)
4. **No Edit After Save**: Once saved, can't edit (future feature)

---

## 📦 Deployment
