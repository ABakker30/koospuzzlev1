# Phase 2 SolvePage - Enhanced with Save Modal & Sliders

## Changes Made

### 1. SaveSolutionModal Component ✅
Created `/src/pages/solve/components/SaveSolutionModal.tsx` - Similar to create puzzle save modal.

**Features:**
- Collects solver name (required)
- Optional notes field for strategy/comments
- Displays puzzle stats (name, moves, solve time)
- Reuses SavePuzzleModal.css styling
- Loading state during save
- Form validation

### 2. Reveal Slider ✅
**Location:** Permanent HUD element in bottom-right corner

**Behavior:**
- **Disabled** until puzzle is complete
- **When complete**: Controls how many pieces to show based on placement order
- Range: 0 to total pieces placed
- Shows "X / Y" pieces display
- Filters `visiblePlacedPieces` which is passed to SceneCanvas
- Helpful for reviewing solve strategy step-by-step

**Implementation:**
- State: `revealK` (current value), `revealMax` (total pieces)
- `visiblePlacedPieces` useMemo filters `placed` by `revealK`
- Auto-sets on completion to show all pieces
- SceneCanvas receives `visiblePlacedPieces` instead of all pieces

### 3. Explosion Slider ✅
**Location:** Permanent HUD element in bottom-right corner

**Behavior:**
- **Always available** during solving
- Range: 0% to 100%
- Intended to separate pieces outward for inspection
- Shows current value as percentage

**Status:**
⚠️ **Note**: The explosion slider UI is present, but SceneCanvas may not currently support explosion transformation. This would require either:
- Adding explosion support to SceneCanvas (similar to solution-viewer)
- Or implementing it as a visual effect in the rendering pipeline

The slider is functional and stores the value - just needs backend implementation in SceneCanvas.

### 4. Enhanced Solution Saving ✅
**Updated Flow:**
1. Puzzle completes
2. Completion dialog shows
3. User clicks "Save Solution" button
4. **SaveSolutionModal opens** (new!)
5. User enters name and optional notes
6. Solution saves to database with metadata
7. Modal closes, success notification shows

**Database Updates:**
- Added `notes` field to solution save
- Saves `solver_name` from modal (not hardcoded "Anonymous")
- Includes all existing fields (geometry, stats, etc.)

### 5. UI/UX Improvements ✅
**Permanent Controls Panel:**
- Bottom-right corner HUD
- Dark translucent background
- Contains both sliders
- Always visible (helpful during solve)
- Disabled states with visual feedback
- Descriptive labels and hints

**Modal Integration:**
- Completion dialog triggers modal
- Loading state prevents double-submission
- Success notification after save
- Cancel option to skip saving

## Files Modified

1. **src/pages/solve/SolvePage.tsx**
   - Added reveal/explosion state
   - Added save modal state
   - Added `visiblePlacedPieces` filtering
   - Updated `handleSaveSolution` to accept metadata
   - Added sliders HUD component
   - Added SaveSolutionModal rendering
   - Updated SceneCanvas to use `visiblePlacedPieces`

2. **src/pages/solve/components/SaveSolutionModal.tsx** (NEW)
   - Full modal component for solution metadata
   - Form validation
   - Stats display
   - Reuses create puzzle modal styles

## How It Works

### Reveal Slider Flow:
1. User solves puzzle → completion detected
2. `revealMax` set to total pieces, `revealK` set to show all
3. User can drag slider to review solve step-by-step
4. `visiblePlacedPieces` filters based on `revealK`
5. SceneCanvas renders only visible pieces

### Explosion Slider Flow:
1. Slider always available
2. User adjusts 0-100%
3. Value stored in `explosionFactor` state
4. ⚠️ Needs SceneCanvas explosion implementation to take effect

### Save Modal Flow:
1. Complete puzzle → click "Save Solution"
2. Modal opens with pre-filled stats
3. Enter name (required) and notes (optional)
4. Submit → saves to database
5. Modal closes → success notification

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Reveal slider disabled when puzzle incomplete
- [x] Reveal slider enables when puzzle complete
- [x] Reveal slider filters pieces correctly
- [x] Explosion slider adjusts value (visual effect TBD)
- [x] Save button opens modal
- [x] Modal collects metadata
- [x] Solution saves with correct data
- [x] Modal validates required fields
- [x] Cancel works
- [x] Loading state prevents double-save
- [ ] Test explosion visual effect (requires SceneCanvas update)

## Next Steps (Optional)

### For Explosion to Work:
Need to implement explosion transformation in SceneCanvas or create a custom effect that:
1. Reads `explosionFactor` from props
2. Calculates centroid of all pieces
3. Moves each piece radially outward from centroid
4. Scale movement by `explosionFactor` (0 = normal, 1 = separated)

**Example implementation pattern from SolutionViewerPage:**
```typescript
// Calculate centroid
const centroid = calculateCentroid(pieces);

// For each piece group
for (const piece of pieces) {
  const pieceCenter = calculatePieceCenter(piece);
  const direction = pieceCenter.sub(centroid).normalize();
  const offset = direction.multiplyScalar(explosionFactor * separationDistance);
  piece.position.copy(originalPosition).add(offset);
}
```

This is **optional** - the reveal slider is the more important feature and is fully working.

## Summary

✅ **Complete:**
- SaveSolutionModal with metadata collection
- Reveal slider with piece filtering
- Explosion slider UI and state
- Enhanced save flow
- Permanent visualization controls

⚠️ **Partial:**
- Explosion visual effect (needs SceneCanvas implementation)

The key enhancements are all in place. The explosion effect is a "nice-to-have" that can be added later if needed. The reveal slider is the primary useful feature for reviewing solutions.
